# SiteBuilder - Your Ultimate Web Development Companion üöÄ

**SiteBuilder** is a powerful web application built for web developers, especially those who frequently participate in hackathons. It leverages AI to generate and display code snippets instantly using the Together AI LLaMA API and HELICONE API. The application also includes a sandbox feature that allows users to easily transfer code into a live editor, saving valuable time during development.

## Why SiteBuilder? ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

As a developer who has participated in numerous hackathons, I‚Äôve experienced firsthand how challenging and time-consuming it can be to set up components from scratch. The pressure to deliver high-quality code within tight deadlines can be overwhelming. **SiteBuilder** was born out of this need to streamline the coding process, allowing developers to focus more on building and less on setup.

By integrating LLaMA's code generation capabilities and providing a seamless transition to a live sandbox environment, I feel like I‚Äôm doing my job like Superman‚Äîempowering developers to move fast and break limits.

## Features ‚ú®

- **AI-Powered Code Generation**: Uses Together AI's LLaMA model via HELICONE API to generate code based on user input.
- **Instant Preview & Sandbox Integration**: With a click of a button, shift the generated code into a sandbox environment for live editing, testing, and further development.
- **Time-Saving Development**: Say goodbye to repetitive component setup and hello to more efficient project development.
- **Tailored for Hackathons**: Perfectly suited for fast-paced environments like hackathons, where every second counts.

## Tech Stack üíª

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS for UI components
- **Backend**: Together AI API (Llama), HELICONE API for code generation and display
- **Integration**: Sandpack for live coding environment

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Generate Code**: Enter your desired code prompt into the input field, and let the power of AI do the heavy lifting.
2. **Display Output**: The generated code is displayed instantly for your review and use.
3. **Send to Sandbox**: Click the "Sandbox" button to transfer the generated code to a live editor. This enables you to further edit, test, and refine your code in real-time‚Äîsaving you hours of setup.
4. **Share Your Code**: When you're ready, share your app directly from the editor to your desired platform.
